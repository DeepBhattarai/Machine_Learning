# Machine_Learning (ML) (Sochastic gradient descent Regression(SGDR))
This repository describes the implementation of the SGDR to predict the taxi price(target feature) based in the different input features(predictors).
# Data source
The data for the ML was extracted from the kaggle website using following link ()
# Objective
The primary objective of this project was to train the mdoel for predicting the taxi price given multiple input feature.
# Methodologies and requirements
The data was converted into pandas dataframe which was then used for data cleaning,processing. Along with this an exploratory data analysis was performed in the dataset.
